# Product Requirements Document: Hysio Assistant

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Hysio Assistant is an AI-powered chat co-pilot specifically designed for physiotherapists in the Netherlands. It serves as an intelligent knowledge base and sparring partner that supports licensed physiotherapists in clinical reasoning, guideline consultation, and structured thinking. The assistant integrates seamlessly into the Hysio Medical Scribe platform while also functioning as a standalone chat interface.

**Problem Statement:** Physiotherapists need quick access to evidence-informed information, clinical reasoning support, and structured guidance during their practice, but existing solutions are either too generic or lack integration with their workflow.

**Goal:** Provide physiotherapists with instant, contextual AI support that enhances their clinical decision-making while maintaining safety boundaries and professional standards.

## 2. Goals

1. **Speed**: Provide immediate answers to clinical and professional questions
2. **Consistency**: Deliver evidence-informed information aligned with Dutch physiotherapy standards (KNGF guidelines)
3. **Safety**: Function as advisory support without replacing clinical decision-making
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration into existing Hysio Medical Scribe workflow
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive chat interface following Hysio brand guidelines
6. **Compliance**: Full GDPR compliance with mandatory clinical disclaimers
