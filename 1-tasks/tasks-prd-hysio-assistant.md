# Tasks for Hysio Assistant Implementation

Based on PRD analysis and current codebase assessment, I have identified the existing infrastructure that can be leveraged:

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- OpenAI API integration (`src/lib/api/openai.ts`) - Ready for GPT-4o
- UI Components library with proper Hysio branding
- Next.js routing structure
- Existing navigation and layout components
- API route structure (`src/app/api/`)
- Existing utilities and type definitions

## Relevant Files

### New Files to Create
- `src/app/assistant/page.tsx` - Main standalone assistant chat page
- `src/components/assistant/chat-interface.tsx` - Core chat component
- `src/components/assistant/message-bubble.tsx` - Individual message display component
- `src/components/assistant/conversation-sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar with conversation history
- `src/components/assistant/assistant-integration.tsx` - Integration component for Medical Scribe
- `src/app/api/assistant/route.ts` - API route for assistant chat completions
- `src/app/api/assistant/conversations/route.ts` - API routes for conversation management
- `src/lib/assistant/system-prompt.ts` - Hysio Assistant system prompt configuration
- `src/hooks/useAssistantChat.ts` - Custom hook for chat functionality
- `src/lib/types/assistant.ts` - TypeScript definitions for assistant features

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/ui/navigation.tsx` - Add assistant navigation link
- `src/components/scribe/intake-workflow.tsx` - Integrate assistant component
- `src/lib/types/index.ts` - Export assistant types
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add assistant route metadata

### Test Files
- `src/components/assistant/chat-interface.test.tsx` - Unit tests for chat interface
- `src/components/assistant/message-bubble.test.tsx` - Unit tests for message bubbles
- `src/hooks/useAssistantChat.test.ts` - Unit tests for chat hook
- `src/app/api/assistant/route.test.ts` - API route tests

### Notes
- Leverage existing OpenAI integration from `src/lib/api/openai.ts`
- Use existing UI components for consistent branding
- Follow established patterns from Medical Scribe integration
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure GDPR compliance and mandatory clinical disclaimers
