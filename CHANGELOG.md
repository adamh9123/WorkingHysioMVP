* Systeem werkte correct in lichte modus, maar dark mode preference activeerde automatisch de donkere achtergrond

**Forensische Correcties Uitgevoerd:**

**1. Dark Mode Media Query Gereviseerd:**
```css
/* VOOR - SABOTEUR GEÏDENTIFICEERD */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  --background: var(--color-deep-green-900);  /* ← DONKERE ACHTERGROND FORCER */
}

/* NA - MINT DOMINANT BEHOUDEN */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  --background: var(--color-mint);             /* ← MINT BEHOUDEN IN ALLE MODI */
}
```

**2. Triple-Redundantie Implementatie:**
